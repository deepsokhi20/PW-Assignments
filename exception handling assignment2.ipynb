    "#Q1 built in exceptions offer information about python related problems and custom exceptions will add information about project related problems. We use exception class while creating a custom Exception in order to inherit all the built in exceptions and using it with custom exception will expand the exception class. Exception class is the super class which means it has all the exceptions so inheriting it in custom exception will help to make a code better as we only create a custom exception when the Exception class don't raise errors because the result is acceptable by the system but not in real world. so when the built in exceptions cannot raise exception, custom class is created which inherits exception class as built in exceptions can also be raised while creating the custom exception "
