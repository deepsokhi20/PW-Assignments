In other words, an eigenvalue λ corresponds to a direction (eigenvector) in the vector space that remains unchanged (up to scaling) after the transformation. Mathematically, for a square matrix \\( A \\), an eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) satisfies the equation:\n",

    "2. **Eigenvectors**: Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that remain in the same direction (up to scaling) after being transformed by a linear transformation represented by a matrix. They represent the directions of linearly independent vectors that are only scaled (not rotated) by the transformation. Eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue are typically considered to belong to the same eigenspace.\n",

    "Now, let's provide a brief proof to support these conditions:\n",

    "Suppose we have a square matrix \\( A \\) of size \\( n \\times n \\). We want to show that \\( A \\) is diagonalizable if and only if it has \\( n \\) linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",

In the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach, the spectral theorem holds particular significance because it guarantees the diagonalizability of symmetric matrices and provides a clear interpretation of their eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
