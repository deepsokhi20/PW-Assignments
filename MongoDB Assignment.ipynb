    "MongoDB is an open source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale data also allows you to work with that data very effieciently. It is catagorized under the NoSQL database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables.\n",
    "The non-relational database is a database that does not store data in tabular form like rows and columns which is found in traditional database systems. In mongoDB data is stored in collection. MongoDB is used as a cloud database, which enables us to build applications faster, handle highly diverse data types and manage applications more efficiently at scale. And most of the time it is possible that the data is unstructured therefore in that case MongoDB is a better option."

    "Schema-less Database: It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can hold different types of documents in it. Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different numbers of fields, content, and size. It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational databases. Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the data is not indexed, then database search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, it creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved from another server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. It is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc."
