    "A database is organized collection data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed. You can organize data into tables, rows, columns and index it to make it easier to find relevant information. The main purpose of database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving and managing data.\n",

    "SQL databases define and manipulate data-based structured query language(SQL). Seeing from a side this language is extremely powerful. SQL is one of the widely- used options available which makes it a safe choice, especially for great complex queries. But from another side, it can be restrictive. SQL requires you to use pedefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also, all of your data must follow the same structure. this can requiree significant up-front prepration which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult diruptive to your whole system.It is not suited for hierarchical data storage. it is good for complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data.  Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store. this flexibility means that documents can be ceated without having a defined structure first. Also each document can have its own unique structure. the syntax varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go. it is used for hierarchical data storage. It is not good for complex queries."
