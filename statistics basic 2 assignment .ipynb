They help quantify the variability or deviation of individual data points from the central tendency (mean, median, mode). Here's how these measures are used to describe the spread of a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the dataset. It gives an idea of the total spread between the extreme values. However, it doesn't account for the distribution of values in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance measures how much the individual data points deviate from the mean of the dataset. It's calculated by averaging the squared differences between each data point and the mean. A higher variance indicates greater spread or variability of data points from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a more easily interpretable measure of dispersion in the same units as the original data. A higher standard deviation indicates more spread-out data points from the mean.\n",
