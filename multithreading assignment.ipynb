    "multithreading is a technique which enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously is known as multithreading or the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading. Multithreading is used as it provides better communication for more than one user at a time without requiring multiple copies of program running on the computer and multithreading provide faster context switching as the context switching time is less between two threads as compared to two processes. threading module is used to handle threads in python."
