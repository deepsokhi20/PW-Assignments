    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. However, they are used under different circumstances and have different assumptions due to the nature of the data and the available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. T-test:**\n",
    "A t-test is used when you want to compare the means of two groups and make inferences about whether there is a significant difference between them. It is especially useful when you have a small sample size (typically less than 30) and when the population standard deviation is unknown. There are two main types of t-tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent Samples t-test:** This is used when you want to compare the means of two independent groups to determine if they are significantly different. For example:\n",
    "  Scenario: You want to know if there is a significant difference in the average test scores of two different classes (Class A and Class B).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Paired Samples t-test:** This is used when you have paired or matched data, and you want to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of the two related groups. For example:\n",
    "  Scenario: You measure the blood pressure of the same group of individuals before and after a medical treatment to see if there is a significant change in blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Z-test:**\n",
    "A z-test is used when you have a larger sample size (typically more than 30) and you know the population standard deviation. It is often used for hypothesis testing when comparing a sample mean to a known population mean. The z-test assumes that the sample comes from a normally distributed population, and it uses the known population standard deviation to make inferences. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: You work for a company that produces light bulbs, and you want to determine if a new production process results in light bulbs that have a different average lifespan than the industry standard. You have a large sample of bulbs and also know the population standard deviation of bulb lifespans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- Use a t-test when you have a small sample size (typically < 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "- Use a z-test when you have a large sample size (typically > 30) and you know the population standard deviation.\n",
    "- Both tests are used to compare means but under different conditions and assumptions. The choice between them depends on your specific data and research question."

    "One-tailed and two-tailed tests are two types of hypothesis tests used in statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-tailed test:** In a one-tailed test, you are interested in determining if a parameter is significantly greater than or less than a certain value.

    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probability of an event based on new evidence or information.

    "**Example: Medical Diagnosis Using Bayes' Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate Bayes' theorem with a classic example of medical diagnosis.\n",

    "  \\(P(B) = (0.01 * 0.98) + (0.99 * 0.05) = 0.0294 + 0.0495 = 0.0789.\n",

    "So, even though John tested positive for Disease X, the probability that he actually has the disease is only about 12.4%.

    "A confidence interval is a statistical range or interval that provides an estimate of the true population parameter (such as the population mean or proportion) along with a level of confidence about the accuracy of that estimate. It is a way to express the uncertainty or margin of error associated with a sample statistic. In simple terms, a confidence interval gives you a range within which you can reasonably expect the true population parameter to fall.\n",

    "\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 175 \\pm (1.96 \\times 1) \\]\n",

    "This gives you a 95% confidence interval of (173.04 cm, 176.96 cm). This means you can be 95% confident that the true average height of adult males in the city falls within this interval.\n",
