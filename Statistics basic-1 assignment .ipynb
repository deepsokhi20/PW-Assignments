    "for example- if a company wants to understand the average salary of its employees by calculating the mean salary the company can provide a straightforward summary of the central tendency of salaries within its workforce\n",

    "2. Inferential statistics- It consists of using data you have measured to form conclusion. these statistics allow us todraw conclusions, make predictions and test hypotheses about populations using sample data. techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis fall under this category.\n",
    "for example- A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug and wants to know if it's effective in reducing blood pressure. They conduct a clinical trial with a sample of participants. By analyzing the data from the trial using inferential statistics, the company can make an informed inference about the effectiveness of the drug in the larger population."

Descriptive statistics help in understanding the basic patterns, trends, and distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores for a class of students. Descriptive statistics could include measures like the mean (average) score, the median (middle value), the range (difference between the highest and lowest scores), and the standard deviation (measure of data spread). These statistics would give you an overview of how well the students performed collectively in the exam\n",

    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involve using sample data to make inferences or draw conclusions about a larger population.

Inferential statistics involve more complex techniques and require assumptions about the population from which the sample was drawn.\n",

    "Example: Suppose you want to determine whether a new teaching method has a significant effect on exam scores. You could conduct an experiment where one group of students is taught using the new method and another group using the traditional method. After analyzing the data, you might find that the group taught using the new method had higher average scores. Inferential statistics, such as hypothesis testing, could then be used to determine if the observed difference is statistically significant, meaning it's unlikely to have occurred by random chance.\n"

    "Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "Mode:\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n",

    "The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.\n",

    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it's used: Standard deviation is widely used because it's in the same units as the data, making it more interpretable. It indicates the typical distance of data points from the mean and provides a measure of overall variability.\n",

    "Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
    "The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (75th percentile) and the first quartile (25th percentile) of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it's used: IQR is less sensitive to outliers than the range. It's used to describe the spread of the middle 50% of the data and can be helpful for identifying variability in skewed datasets.\n",
