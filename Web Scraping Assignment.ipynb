    "Suppose if you have to a new phone then you will go to the any e-commerce website like amazon, flipkart etc to check the reviews and specifications but if you want to know about so many phones in small interval of time then web scraping is used. To extract the large amount of content from a website is called web scrapping. It is used to do large amount of fork in a short period and it also gives better access to the data. It is used in e-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc for extracting data."

    "human copy and paste- Manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet is the most basic form of web scraping. Even the best web-scraping technology cannot always replace a human’s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and this may be the only viable option when the websites for scraping explicitly prohibit machine automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing - Many websites contain large collections of pages that are dynamically generated from an underlying structured source, such as a database. A common script or template is typically used to encode data from the same category into similar pages. A wrapper is a program in data mining that detects such templates in a specific information source, extracts its content, and converts it to a relational form.\n",
    "\n",
    "DOM Parsing - DOM parsing allows you to parse HTML or XML documents into their corresponding Document Object Model (DOM) representation. DOM Parser is part of the W3C standard that provides methods to navigate the DOM tree and extract desired information from it, such as text or attributes."
